# This is the python code for Sentiment Analysis
<br>
This is a Sentiment Analysis Model for a restraunt where we can get to know the positive ratio by the feedbacks got by the customers.
I have provided a dataset which we feed to our algorithm so that it can learn to categorize feedbacks of the customers as positive or negative.
This can help a company or an organisation in Stratergy building, Data Analysis, etc.
